# Yen-Forecast-Machine-Learning-Algorithm

## Overview 

- Machine Learning algorithm that utilizes time series forecasting and linear regression modeling to determine whether there is any predictable behavior for Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures.
- Decomposed historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data into noise and trend using the Hodrick Prescott Filter
- Forecasted returns using an ARMA model
- Forecasted settlement price using an ARIMA model
- Forecasted volatility using a GARCH model.
- Determined that volatility and price were expected to increase.
- Tools / languages: JupyterLab, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, arch, statsmodels, time series forecasting, linear regression modeling
